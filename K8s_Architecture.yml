# K8s Architecture
Components of K8s Architecture:
    Control Plane/ Master Node.
    Worker Node (can be multiple).

Control Plane/ Master Node:
    API-Server:
        Kubernetes Api server kade vicharayla sagle yetat (Big boss of the house).
        Main component of K8s architecture.
        Listens to all requests.
    
    Control Manager:
        It is responsible to maintain the state of resource.
        Actual State = Desired State.
        It also manages the PODs.

    Kube Schedular:
        It is responsible for doing the actual work.

Worker Node:       
    POD:
        It is an atomic unit(smallest unit) of K8s.
        Containers are created inside of POD.
        Containers are tightly coupled inside POD.
        POD is controlled by kubelet.
        No POD can communicate with each other.
        
    Kubelet:
        Kubelet is responsible for controlling POD.
        Kublet will send request to api-server for creating POD.
        
    Kubr Proxy:
        IP assigning is done by Kube Proxy.
        Networking ka kam is done by Kube Proxy.
        Container dosen't have IP address in K8s.
        Ip address is given to POD.
